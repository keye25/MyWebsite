## Project Background

As part of a simulated project assigned by my university, I participated in a challenge to develop a **Padel club business plan** for a virtual entrepreneur. Padel is a rapidly growing racket sport, and the project assumed the entrepreneur needed to establish a new Padel club in the Paris ÃŽle-de-France region of France. The objective was to submit a **5-year business plan to a bank** to secure funding. Our task was to build **a comprehensive Excel tool for financial data analysis**, project performance forecasting, and strategic recommendations.

## My Core Contributions

In this project, I collaborated closely with my team to successfully develop a **powerful and user-friendly Excel tool** to support the business plan's creation.

### End-to-End Excel Modeling

1. Built a **financial model with over 20 dynamic formulas**, enabling real-time linkage between input parameters (rent, customer traffic, pricing, etc.) and output metrics (cash flow, ROI, break-even point).
2. Designed **three scenario switching functions** (pessimistic/baseline/optimistic) to demonstrate risk resistance through sensitivity analysis.
3. Developed an **automated validation system** to provide real-time alerts for input errors and formula link breaks.

### Strategic Decision Support

1. **Timeline Control System**: Allowed for comparison of operational data from 2023-2025.
2. **Scenario Simulation Module**: Included three preset parameter groups: Base Case, Best Case, and Worst Case.
3. **Decision-Making Tool**: The Check module allowed testing the impact of different operational strategy combinations and provided business recommendations.

## Background

This project was developed as part of a school assignment, where I was tasked with building a **comprehensive Power BI solution** for an IT company named *ServiceSpot*. My mission was to consolidate and transform the data, and create a user-friendly report to help management monitor performance and improve service quality.

## 1. Data Modeling and Transformation

1. Connected and merged **multiple data sources** using Power Query.
2. Applied **necessary transformations** to prepare clean, analysis-ready tables.
3. Designed a **star-schema data model** with **a single fact table**, adhering to best practices for simplicity and performance.
4. Created **DAX measures** to answer key business questions

## 2. Report Design and User Experience

To ensure a smooth and intuitive exploration experience for business users, I structured the dashboard into **six interactive report pages**, each serving a specific analytical purpose:

### (1) Overview  
A high-level summary page offering a **birdâ€™s-eye view** of key KPIs, including total calls, SLA compliance rate, and average wait/call duration. This page acts as an entry point for executives to quickly assess the overall performance of the call center.

### (2) Total Calls  
Focused on the **volume and distribution of calls**, this page breaks down inbound calls by date, time of day, weekday, and call type. A special highlight is the **time-of-day segmentation (early morning, late morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, evening)**, which uncovers customer behavior trends and peak traffic periods.

### (3) Abandon & Wait  
This page provides insights into **customer drop-off behavior**. It includes average **waiting time by time segment**, and **abandon time by call type**, helping managers identify when and why customers are hanging up. The visuals combine line and bar charts with slicers to support flexible filtering.

### (4) Revenue  
A compact yet impactful page showing **revenue breakdown by U.S. states**. Conditional formatting and sorting make it easy to identify which regions contribute most to the business, enabling **geo-targeted marketing or staffing decisions**.

### (5) Team  
Designed for management-level analysis, this page reveals which **team managers oversee the most responsive teams**, based on the number of calls answered and SLA compliance. Visual cues such as data bars and ranking indexes allow for fast comparison.

### (6) Employee Details  
A granular-level view into **individual employee performance**, including average call duration and SLA compliance per agent. This section is valuable for **HR evaluation, training needs assessment, and incentive planning**.

## Project 1 bilibili Overview

This project highlights my experience as a **Product Manager at Bilibili.com**, a leading Chinese video-sharing platform known for its vibrant user community and diverse content across anime, gaming, lifestyle, and education. The platform is particularly famous for its **interactive bullet comments (danmu)** that enhance real-time engagement.

## My Role & Contributions

As the product owner for a core content module, I was responsible for several feature developments and optimizations:

- **Modularized Content Publishing**  
  Re-structured the content creation process into modular paths to significantly enhance publishing flexibility and efficiency for creators.

- **Integrated Audio-Video Continuous Play**  
  Led the development of a seamless playback experience, boosting user watch time and reducing content drop-off.

- **A/B Testing for Ad Display Optimization**  
  Designed and analyzed multiple A/B experiments to improve ad interaction and raise CTR through refined display strategies.

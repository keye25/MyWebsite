## Background
As part of the Data Governance course at School, I collaborated with a team to analyze a business case on Paack Inc., a parcel delivery company that stands out by allowing customers to schedule their deliveries. Our goal was to apply data governance and strategy concepts to address real-world challenges and support Paack’s growth in the competitive logistics sector.

In this project, we focused on:
1. Evaluating how Paack uses data to support its unique value propositions and business strategy.
2. Identifying critical data needs, collection methods, and limitations as the company scales.
3. Proposing data governance roles, actionable strategies, and plans to overcome challenges and drive sustainable growth.

My contribution included researching Paack’s data strategy and presenting insights on optimizing their data culture for future expansion. This project deepened my understanding of applying data governance frameworks to practical business scenarios.
